# counter as carstate last saw it, covering the Python→boardd→USB latency so the value

    # cruiseState.enabled. ADAS stays at ACC_Off until it sees ICC_ACCSwt=1 (and the
    # other byte-4 fields) in a valid 0x52A — i.e. the spoof is what enables ACC to
    # transition out of Off into Standby/Active. Gating on cruiseState.enabled was

    # first, and the spoof was never sent because cruise wasn't enabled.
